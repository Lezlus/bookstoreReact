But the road to this pinnacle of spiritual power runs through the Shaman Fight, a gauntlet of battles with rival mediums who call forth dizzying powers from the world of the dead in their own bids for the crown. At Yoh\u2019s side is Anna, his coach, fianc\u00e9e, and a powerful medium in her own right. Sure, it\u2019d be nice if Yoh had a little more time to train and mature\u2026but the Shaman Fight is only held once every 500 years, so he\u2019s going to have to grow up quick!\n\n",
